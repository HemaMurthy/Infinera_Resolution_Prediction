# Infinera_Resolution_Prediction

# Problem Statement: 
Given data of 2018 and 2019 with 72 different types of resolution codes along with Subject and descriptions, we need to construct a classification model that predicts the most probable resolution of the user's query. 

# Strategy:

# Data Clean-up
# Text preprocessing
# Vectorization
# Split, Train and Test
# Cross validate results
